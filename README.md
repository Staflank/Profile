* We tested the compliance of electrical cables with relevant ISO standards by performing experiments such as wall thickness and tensile-rupture strength. In this way, we ensured the reliability and sustainability of the cables.

* In the IP laboratory, we tested the durability of the devices against extreme conditions by conducting water and dust permeability experiments, especially on lighting devices.
